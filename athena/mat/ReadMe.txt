Follow the steps to run the code

1) Put the un-skewed images into one folder 
2) Change the code of RotateImageRandomly.m to point to the folder where the un-skewed images are and generate a set of rotated images
3) Run the main_function.m to, for example, compute the skew angles and see the de-skewed images (see the AngleResults folder)

ps: ImageMagick is installed in order to convert eps files into more easily readable png files
